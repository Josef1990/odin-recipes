              <h3>Step-by-step</h3>
                 <h4>Eggplant</h4>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Place eggplant slightly overlapping in a large colander. Sprinkle with some salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant.</li>
                        <li>Leave to sweat for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, make Meat Sauce and Béchamel Sauce.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 240C/450F. </li>
                        <li>Pat eggplant dry - make sure to do this well, otherwise it's too salty. Lay on parchment paper lined trays (you might need 3 trays, work in batches), brush with oil.</li>
                        <li>Bake 15 - 20 minutes or until lightly browned and softened . Remove and set aside to cool slightly.</li>
                      </ol>
                 <h4>Meat sauce</h4>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pot over high heat, then cook the garlic and onion for 2 minutes. </li>
                        <li>Add the beef or lamb and cook until it changes from pink to brown, breaking it up as you go.</li>
                        <li>Add wine, cook for 1.5 minutes or until alcohol smell is gone.</li>
                        <li>Add remaining ingredients and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, then lower heat to medium low and cook for 15 minutes, or until reduced to a thick sauce.</li>
                      </ol>
                 <h4>Bechamel Sauce</h4>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.</li>
                        <li>Stirring constantly, slowly add the milk. Then stir regularly for 3 to 5 minutes or until it thickens so that it thickly coats the back of a wooden spoon (see video / step photos).</li>
                        <li>Remove from the stove and whisk in cheese, nutmeg, vegetable/stock powder (or salt) and pepper.</li>
                        <li>Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then whisk the eggs in. Cover with lid until required.</li>
                      </ol>
                 <h4>Assemble</h4>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Lower oven to 180C/350F (all oven types).</li>
                        <li>Place half the eggplant in the bottom of a baking dish (I used my 26cm/9" Lodge skillet), then top with all the Filling.</li>
                        <li>Top with remaining eggplant, then pour over the Béchamel Sauce, sprinkle with breadcrumbs. </li>
                        <li>Bake for 30 - 40 minutes or until golden brown. Allow to stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
                      </ol>
